# Project Overview
---
The aim of this research proposal is to develop and assess the effectiveness of SOLVEAURA, an innovative voice-enabled step-by-step explanation system, designed to empower visually impaired pupils at Lions School for the Visually Impaired in their pursuit of advanced mathematics education beyond ninth grade. SOLVEAURA seeks to address the unique learning challenges faced by visually impaired pupils in comprehending complex mathematical concepts, thereby fostering a more inclusive and effective learning environment.

### Background
Mathematics is a crucial foundation for cognitive development and academic success. However, visually impaired pupils face significant challenges when it comes to engaging with mathematical concepts. Traditional educational methods often fall short in accommodating their unique learning needs, hindering their access to advanced mathematics education beyond the ninth grade. Visual impairment impacts the ability to perceive visual representations, making it difficult to understand complex mathematical structures and equations.

In response to this challenge, emerging technologies like voice recognition, natural language processing, and adaptive explanations offer promising avenues for creating inclusive and effective learning tools. By harnessing these technologies, it becomes possible to provide visually impaired students with interactive and accessible platforms that enable them to comprehend advanced mathematical concepts.

### Problem Statement
The Lions School for the Visually Impaired recognises the importance of providing a comprehensive and inclusive mathematics education for their pupils beyond the ninth grade. However, the absence of tailored educational tools and resources presents a significant barrier to their academic progress and their career prospects are limited to what they ca n learn. Visually impaired pupils struggle to access and internalise complex mathematical concepts due to the lack of specialised learning materials that cater to their learning needs.

Although there is an availability of such applications available such as Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Microsoft SeeingAI, these tools are limited in there own nature and availability to the local pupils in Zambia. However, software such as JAWS helps to address this but is also limited in that it cannot be used for learning complex mathematics.

The proposed project: SOLVEAURA, aims to leverage the capabilities of voice-enabled technology to create an innovative solution that empowers visually impaired pupils to explore and understand advanced mathematical topics through auditory explanations. By doing so, SOLVEAURA endeavours to bridge the educational divide and enhance the learning experience for this underserved demographic, thereby promoting inclusivity and equal access to higher mathematics education.
